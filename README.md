### When possible, follow the wires color scheme:

-BLACK for GND (dark colors if not available)

-RED   for POWER (3.3V / 5V / VIN) (bright colors if not available)

-Bright Colored for read and write signal 
(use red when none available and black only as a last option)

-We know it is not always possible to respect this due to lack of wires,
 but the firstrule is NOT USE BLACK FOR POWER OR RED FOR GND!
