# Homework 2

## Task Requirements
Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk. 
I used:
- two LEDs to represent traffic lights for people ğŸ”´ ğŸŸ¢
- three LEDs to represent traffic lights for cars ğŸ”´ ğŸŸ¡ ğŸŸ¢

Used components:
 - 5 LEDs
 - 1 button
 - 1 buzzer (passive)
 - 5 x 330 Î© resistors and 1 x 100 Î© resistor
 - 12 wires

### The traffic lights system has 4 states:

#### State 1 - default, reinstated after state 4 ends
 - ğŸŸ¢ for ğŸš—
 - ğŸ”´ for ğŸ‘«
 -  Duration = indefinite (changed by pressing the button)

#### State 2 - initiated after 8 seconds after the button is pressed in state 1
 - ğŸŸ¡ for ğŸš—
 - ğŸ”´ for ğŸ‘«
 -  No sounds
 -  Duration = 3 seconds

#### State 3 - initiated after state 2 ends
  - ğŸ”´ for ğŸš—
  - ğŸŸ¢ for ğŸ‘«
  - Constant beeping from the buzzer
  - Duration = 8 seconds

#### State 4 - initiated after state 3 ends
  - ğŸ”´ for ğŸš—
  - Blinking ğŸŸ¢ for ğŸ‘«
  - Constant beeping from the buzzer, faster then in state 3
  - Duration = 4 seconds

â€¼ If I press the button in any state rather than STATE 1 should NOT yield any actions.

## Setup

## Let's see how it works

[Demo for one button press](https://youtu.be/jeSTIqOnYK0)

[Demo for multiple button press](https://youtu.be/TSNSQOE1npg)

ğŸ”¼ In this demo I press the button multiple times to show that if the system is not in state 1 then nothing is happening
